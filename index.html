<div class="section">
	<H2>UNDERSTANDING THE WEB</H2> 
	    <p> You access the Internet via a <b>browser</b> on your computer <em>(e.g., Chrome, Firefox, etc.)</em>.
	    The Internet protocol, <b>HTTP</b>, manages how data is transferred from your browser to the Internet 
	    and then back to your computer. The Internet is comprised of millions of <b>servers</b> which communicate
	    and send back <i>(via HTTP)</i> data based on what you're doing via your browser. Most of what you see
            on the Internet are <b>HTML</b> files.</p>

<div class="section">
	<H2>BEGINNING HTML</H2>
	    <p> HTML is the language of the Internet. The HTML language is comprised of <b>tags</b> "&lt; &gt;" and <b>elements</b>.
	    <em>(e.g., title, body, h1).</em> Most HTML tags have both an "opening" tag "&lt; &gt;" and a "closing" tag "&lt;&#47; &gt;". 
	    The content you want to effect with the tag should be written between the "opening" and "closing" tag(s). HTML tags 
	    that do not "close" <em>(i.e., do not have a "closing" tag)</em> are called <b>void</b> tags.</p>

	    <p> Every HTML page must begin with certain "system information". This information is read by the browser and 
		must be stored in the HTML "header". HTML "header" information is everything above the opening <b><em>body</em></b> tag.
		Everything between the "opening" <b><em>body</em></b> tag and the "closing <b><em>body</em></b> tag is what 
		will appear on your webpage.</p>

  		<p><b>This is BOLDED text, but this tag is no longer supported in HTML 5.</b>
  		<strong>This is also BOLDED text. This is the current, supported tag for bolding text in HTML 5.</strong></p>

		<p><i>This is ITALICIZED text, but this tag is no longer supported in HTML 5.</i>
 		<em>This is also ITALICIZED text. This is the current, supported tag for italicizing text in HTML 5.</em></p>

	<H2>"INLINE" & "BLOCK" ELEMENTS</H2>
		<p> <strong>Inline</strong> elements <em>(such as the "anchor", "line break", "image", and "span" tags)</em> are 
		HTML tags that <span style="color:green"><strong>do <u>not</u> affect the area around the text</strong>.</span> 
		It treats the text like other text on the same line. <span style="color:orange">Inline tags (like "span") will keep
		text enclosed in the tags on the same line as the surrounding text.</span></p>

		<p><strong>Block</strong> elements <em>(such as the "paragraph", "form", and "div" tags)</em> are HTML tags that 
		<strong> do affect the area around the text</strong> by essentially putting an <em>invisible box</em> around 
		the text, allowing you to set the specific width and/or height of the <em>box</em></p>. <div style="color:orange">
		Block tags will push text enclosed in the tags to a new line.</div> <em>"Do you <u>'see'</u> the 
		<strong>'invisible box'</strong> surrounding the text on the line above?"</em><br><br>

<div class="section">
	<H2>MORE ON "INLINE" & "BLOCK" ELEMENTS</H2>
		<p> Using <strong>Inline</strong> and <strong>Block</strong> tags/elements can help to add structure to your webpage. 
		Before beginning any webpage design, you should begin with a "sketch" or "mock-up" of how the page should look. 
		Irregardless of your design, you'll begin to see that everything on your page can be "put into a box". Once you 
		identify the overall "box design" of your page, you can create your "boxes", or "content containers" using 
		Block tags <em>(like div)</em>, or creating specific classes <em>(like header and footer)</em>, using <strong>CSS</strong>.</p>

	<H2>BROWSER DEVELOPER TOOLS</H2>
		<p> When the browser reads an HTML file, it generates a <strong>"tree-like structure"</strong> referred to as a 
		<strong>"Document Object Model"</strong>. In simpler terms, the browser makes a "mock-up" of your webpage. The 
		difference is the browser's "sketch" is a bit more complex. To view the <strong>"DOM"</strong> for your webpage, 
		open the <strong>"Developer Tools"</strong> menu option in your browser. You can use <strong>"Developer Tools"</strong>
		to make <strong><em>temporary</em></strong> changes to your webpage without editing the actual HMTL code.</p><br>

<a id="Part3"><H3> Part 3: Adding Style to Your Webpage with CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)</H3></a>
<div class="section1">
	<H2 class="section">FORMATTING WITH CSS</H2>
		<p>While HTML provides the content for a webpage, CSS is what let's you "make it pretty". CSS, while it works with HTML,
		has it's own language, syntax, and rules. You can link to an <strong>external CSS file</strong>, incorporate 
		<strong>internal CSS</strong> styles in the header of an .html page, or create an <span style=color:blue>inline CSS</span> 
		style anywhere on a webpage.</p>

		<p>Using CSS decreases the amount of HTML tags needed for a particular look/feel, and helps to avoid repeating tags when you 
		want to re-use a style on multiple parts of the same page. This becomes more and more important as your website becomes larger.
		Imagine creating a 15-page website with a specific color-scheme for every paragraph of text on each page, and then your client 
		tells you that they want to use a different color-scheme. If you didn't use CSS, you would have to make the color code changes
		on <strong>ALL 15 pages</strong>! Fortunately for you, however, you took this course and knew to use CSS. And because you created 
		a class that defined the color-scheme, you only have to change the color code <strong>once in the CSS style definition</strong>
		you created...<strong>whew</strong>!</p><br>
